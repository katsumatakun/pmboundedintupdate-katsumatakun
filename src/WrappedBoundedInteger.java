public class WrappedBoundedInteger {

/*
A WrappedBoundedInteger is similar to the BoundedInteger.
However, instead of generating exceptions for illegal values,
this class "wraps around".

For example, suppose that we have a WrappedBoundedInteger "minutes"
with bounds of 0 to 59 and whose value is 52.
Adding 10 to this object gives it a value of 2.
